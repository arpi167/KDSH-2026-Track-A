# Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2026 – Track A

## Overview
This project implements a narrative consistency reasoning system using Pathway
for ingestion and chunking, sentence-transformer embeddings, and LLM-based
claim extraction and reasoning.

## Pipeline
1. Narrative ingestion with Pathway
2. Smart chunking
3. Embedding generation
4. Claim extraction
5. Consistency reasoning
6. Final prediction output

## Output
Final predictions are available in:
data/processed/results.csv

## Notes
Some components (retrieval) may require specific Pathway runtime setup.
Core logic and outputs are provided.
